This is part 2/2 of the webinar/workshop series on "Enhancing data support: Reproducibility" held at CSC in October 2025.

Part 1 introduced the concept of reproducibility in research and highlighted its importance.

This workshop will discuss two tools often involved when discussing reproducible computational reasearch: GitHub and Jupyter.

However, the time in this workshop is too short to give a full practical introduction of the tools.

We mainly want to provide a safe environment to experience these tools and give you some pointers as to when and where they are useful to inftroduce researchers to, as well as how they might be useful in your own work, even if you are not programming yourself.

## Prerequisites

This is a lesson targeted at beginners, no prior knowledge of GitHub or Jupyter is needed. 

If you would like to get your hands in the dirt and play around with the tools of this webinar, please come prepared with:

- A GitHub account (https://samumantha.github.io/github-jupyter-4-ds/github-account/)
- Access to our Noppe workspace (https://samumantha.github.io/github-jupyter-4-ds/noppe/); If you have HAKA, VIRTU or CSC account, use those methods to log in, if you do not know what these are or do not have one already, you do not have to do anything about it. We will fix during the workshop, if you want to try it.

## Learning outcomes

- Discover best practices and understand the basic principles of version control and interactive computing platforms to support computational reproducibility.
- Utilize the basic features of GitHub and Jupyter.
- Know where those tools can be run and found.
