# GitHub account

In this workshop, we use the public GitHub service and you need an
account at <https://github.com> and a [supported web
browser](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/). Basic GitHub
accounts are free.

> ## Why GitHub
>
> We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
>
> We also encourage course participants to use our new [Nordic research software repository platform hosted in Denmark](https://nordic-gitlab.deic.dk),
> for more information see [https://coderefinery.org/repository/](https://coderefinery.org/repository/).

If you are concerned about the personal information to reveal to GitHub, for
example how to keep your email address private, please review [these
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.


## Create a GitHub account

1. Go to <https://github.com>.
2. Click on the "Sign up" at the right-top corner.
3. Enter your username of your choice (if it is already used, you will get some suggestions), email address, and password.
4. Follow further instruction and verify your account.

GitHub may require you to enable multi-factor authentication
(MFA). This is generally a good thing, but may take some time to set
up. Luckily, you probably don't have to do this immediately. If you
are prompted to enable MFA before the end of the workshop, follow
GitHub's instructions since they are usually pretty good.


## How to verify that this worked

If you can log in to <https://github.com>, you should be good to go.
