# Introduction

To make use of either of the tools presented in this workshop, one main prerequisite has to be met by the researcher: The work has to be logged in some way. 
These tools cannot help (much) with descriptions of workflows in a graphical user interface, such as Excel or point & click/drag and drop tools. 

## What makes Programming better than Excel for handling research data?

- **Automation**: Scripts can be reused and automated, reducing repetitive tasks.
- **Scalability**: Excel struggles with large datasets, while e.g. pandas (a library in the Python ecosystem) handles millions of rows efficiently.
- **Version control**: Code and data processing steps can be tracked using Git.
- **Reproducibility**: Your workflow can be repeated or shared exactly by others.
- **Visualization and analysis**: Seamless integration with powerful libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
- **Error prevention**: Fewer manual steps mean fewer opportunities for copy-paste mistakes.
- **Integration**: Easily connects with databases, APIs, and other formats like JSON, HDF5, etc.
- **Documentation**: Steps in the processing pipeline can more easily be recorded. 

-> GitHub can help with collaboration and sharing of textbased formats
-> Jupyter can help with documentation of code, as well as interactive exploration

    Features
    Examples
    Exercise:  Playtime
            Breakoutrooms/ or just options: 
                Beginner: Working on own clean repo
                Advanced: Collaborating on same repo 
        Work on recipe book in GitHub (like this one: https://github.com/eglerean/data-stewards-recipe-book) 

Jupyter: (basic materials: https://coderefinery.github.io/programming4ds/jupyter/)

    Documentation and code
        start vs end of project
    Features
    own instance vs Noppe, Colab etc
    Jupyter, RStudio, Pluto etc
    Exercise: Playtime
        Play around with some Features on Noppe, hinting on issues
        Editing a figure (precipitation and temperature)?
