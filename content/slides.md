## Questions

Interrupt at any time, Zoom chat or raise hand

---

## Chatter

TODO: describe

---

## Two perspectives

- Researcher
- Research support

---


## Reproducibility + Replicability

TODO: Link to Slides from Josefine 18 or 39

---

TODO: Overview: In terms of code, what needs to be shared/documented to enable reproducibility + replicability

---

Code that works and is shared is not the same as reproducible code

---

## Version control

- Version control is a tool that can **record snapshots of a project**.
- You can think of version control like regularly taking a photo of your work.

---

## GitHub

-> one place to find the source of software (code), webpages, presentations, books, games, ...

> ...under development

and a place to collaborate and share

---

## Git and Git+

Git, Subversion, Mercurial: Tool/format for version control (terminal + inbuilt)

GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, ...: Service that provides hosting for Git repositories with a nice web interface -> Share and collaborate

---

## Repositories - a place to stroe

From GitHub: A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

Personal or Organization namespace

## Cloning - finding something you want to use, not change

get the latest (working) version on your computer

---

## GitHub workflow - coder

Local development -> snapshot to history (using git)

-> GitHub repository for sharing, storage

--- 

## Commit

Snapshot of current state
... like taking a picture

## GitHub workflow - coder collaboration

Local development by two or more people

Issues: overwriting, divergence
-> forks and branches

---

## Fork

Get the work on your namespace in GitHub and work on it there
You can clone from there too

---

## My own GitHub repository

1. clone: get a copy to my computer
2. work on it, make updates, ...
3. commit: take snapshots of units of work (one to many)
4. Push: submit snapshots to GitHub

- Pull: Get latest version from GitHub

---

## Branches and merge

![](gopher.png)

---

## Pull request

Making a suggestion.

A request to merge.

---

## Making a suggestion - Full workflow

1. Suggest idea: Issue
2. Discussion -> OK
3. Get the work: (fork) - clone - pull - 
4. Work: work - commit (x XX) - 
5. Put it on GitHub: push - 
6. Suggest work: Pull request - 
7. Accept: merge

-> You made it to history!

---

## Demo: Starting new

Create a new repo

- Namespace
- Name
- Description
- README
- LICENSE
- .gitignore

---

## Demo: Add new file

- edit
- commit
- main

History

---

## Summary - words

repository
issue
pull request
clone
commit
fork
branch

---

## Tracking files

TODO: yes and no + examples

---

## Demo - exploring an existing repo

- History
- branches
- forks
- issues
- pull requests

---

## Demo - contribute

- Issue
- Fork, branch
- work
- pull request

new file vs changing file

---

## Is sharing work on GitHub FAIR?

Findable?
Accessible?
Interoperable?
Reusable?

---

## Motivation to use Git(Hub)

- “It broke... hopefully I have a working version somewhere?”
- "Where is the latest version, and which one should I trust?"
- "I am sure it used to work. What changed, when, and why?"
- "When did this problem appear?"
- “Something looks different — what was updated, and who did it?”

---

## Summary

GitHub: Collaborate and share with others and yourself
