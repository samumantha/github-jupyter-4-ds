# Introduction to Programming for Data Science

In this introductory-level workshop, we will learn the very basics of programming for data science.
What does it mean to code? To "run a script"? Variables and functions?

We will work in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for its simplicity to get started writing
code even without any previous experience. We will learn how to produce some **reproducible plots** using
[Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) and in general how to find your way with programming in Python or R.


## Who is the course for?

- Somebody starting with Python or curious about Python.
- Somebody who needs
  to read, process, and plot data for their work or studies and would like to
  try it out with Python.

:::{prereq} Preparations
- No programming language experience needed, we will start from zero and learn the basics together
- Computer with network access
- {doc}`installation`
:::


## What is not taught?

- Version control. Although super useful it is outside of this workshop.
- Python outside a Jupyter Notebook (e.g. on terminal, or VScode, or spyder) 
- Python sets and tuples are only mentioned.
- File input/output is only used via libraries and doing "own" file-I/O is only part
  of optional material.
- How to choose the right visualization format for the data at hand.
- Python object oriented design.
- Python packaging.
- NumPy arrays.
- Managing environments and installing Python packages.
