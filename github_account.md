# GitHub account

In this workshop, we use the public GitHub service and you need an
account at <https://github.com> and a [supported web
browser](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/). Basic GitHub
accounts are free.

If you are concerned about the personal information to reveal to GitHub, for
example how to keep your email address private, please review [these
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.


## Create a GitHub account

1. Go to <https://github.com>.
2. Click on the "Sign up" at the right-top corner.
3. Enter your username of your choice (if it is already used, you will get some suggestions), email address, and password.
4. Follow further instruction and verify your account.

GitHub may require you to enable multi-factor authentication
(MFA). This is generally a good thing, but may take some time to set
up. Luckily, you probably don't have to do this immediately. If you
are prompted to enable MFA before the end of the workshop, follow
GitHub's instructions since they are usually pretty good.


## How to verify that this worked

If you can log in to <https://github.com>, you should be good to go.
